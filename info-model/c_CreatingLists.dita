  <title>Creating Lists</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>Lists can assist users in scanning for and locating information quickly. When written
      correctly, they present information in a logical order, in small, easily understood pieces.
      When writing lists, keep in mind the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul id="ul_ecg_tfs_j4">
      <li>Write lists in a parallel structure. For example, if one list item starts with a verb,
        make all list items do so; if one list item is a complete sentence, make all items complete
        sentences.</li>
      <li>Include all common information from the list items in the introductory sentence to avoid
        repetition.</li>
      <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>If the introductory
        sentence ends with a colon in anticipation of the list to come, do not close the paragraph
        element before starting the list. In this case, the list is part of the preceding
        paragraph.<?oxy_custom_end?></li>
      <li>If the list is not logically part of the preceding paragraph, close the paragraph element
        before beginning the list. The paragraph should end with a period, and all list items should
        also be complete sentences.</li>
      <li>Use complete sentences to introduce the list. Do not make the sentence grammatically
        dependent on the list items by completing the sentence with them.<note>Do not introduce
          lists within prerequisite sections at all. The headings are enough for the user to
          understand the purpose of the list.</note></li>
      <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Do not create
        single-item lists, except in prerequisite sections.<?oxy_custom_end?> See <xref
          href="c_TaskAuthoringGuidelines.dita#AuthoringGuidelines/section_l1k_222_q4"/>.</li>
      <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Unless the list appears
        in a reference topic, try to limit the number of items to fewer than
        nine.<?oxy_custom_end?></li>
    </ul>
    <section>
      <title>Choosing the Appropriate List Type</title>
      <p><keyword keyref="companyname"/> uses three list types. Choose the list type based on the type of content
        it contains, not the way that you think it will be formatted:<ul id="ul_pk5_dy2_yg">
          <li>Use an <term>unordered list</term> when the sequence of items in the list is not
            relevant. The items will be formatted with bullets.</li>
          <li>Use an <term>ordered list</term> when the sequence of items is important. The items
            will be formatted with numbers.</li>
          <li>Use a <term>definition list </term>when defining or comparing a series of items.
            Although you might also choose to use a two-column table, use a definition list when you
            have a two-part structure made up of a term or short phrase followed by a longer
            explanation of the term or phrase. </li>
        </ul><draft-comment>IF company allows simple list (outside of figure callouts) or parml,
          include them in this list as well and add corresponding sections to this
          document.</draft-comment></p><p><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>You do not need to use any
        list element if you have a list of three or less, single-word
        items.<?oxy_custom_end?><codeblock>&lt;p><keyword keyref="companyname"/> uses three list types: unordered, ordered, and definition.&lt;/p></codeblock></p>

      <title>Writing Unordered Lists</title>
      <p>An unordered list begins with a &lt;ul> element and contains any number of nested &lt;li> elements:<dl>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>&lt;ul&gt; unordered list</dt>
            <dd><indexterm>unordered lists &lt;ul></indexterm>Start an unordered list with the
              &lt;ul&gt; element. This element is the container for all unordered list items; it
              does not contain any text itself.</dd>
          </dlentry>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>&lt;li&gt; list item</dt>
            <dd><indexterm>list item &lt;li></indexterm>Use an &lt;li&gt; element for each item in
              the list; there is no limit to the number of list items you can include. You can nest
              other block elements, such as paragraphs and notes within the &lt;li&gt; element, but
              their use should be limited.</dd>
          </dlentry>
        </dl></p>
      <p>When writing unordered lists, follow these guidelines:<ul id="ul_wlq_w1l_yg">
          <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>In general, list
            items in an unordered list should be short so that the list is scannable. If you find
            that you are including more than two sentences in your list items, consider if the
            information would be better included in another way.<?oxy_custom_end?></li>
          <li>Arrange the list items in a logical way, such as alphabetically. If necessary, provide
            an introductory explanation about how the list is organized. </li>
          <li>Indicate how the list items relate to each other; for example, are they mutually
            exclusive items, where only one can be true at a time, or can more than one or all apply
            to the situation.</li>
          <li>Ensure that it is clear whether the list is comprehensive, showing all available
            options, or only a subset of the possibilities. For example, the words "including" or
            "such as" imply the list is not complete, while the words "if applicable" imply the list
            may contain more items than apply to the user's specific situation.</li>
        </ul></p>

      <title>Writing Ordered Lists</title>
      <p>An ordered list begins with an &lt;ol> element and contains any number of nested &lt;li>
        elements:<dl>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>&lt;ol&gt; ordered list</dt>

            <dt>&lt;li&gt; list item</dt>
            <dd><indexterm>list item &lt;li></indexterm>Use an &lt;li&gt; element for each item in the
              list; there is no limit to the number of list items you can include. You can nest other
              block elements, such as paragraphs and notes within the &lt;li&gt; element, but their
              use should be limited.</dd>
          </dlentry>
        </dl></p>
      <p>When writing ordered lists, follow these guidelines:<ul id="ul_whx_2bl_yg">
          <li>Do not use an ordered list to document task steps within a concept or reference topic.
            Instead, use a task topic and &lt;step> elements.</li>
          <li>Avoid using imperative verbs in ordered lists. The use of an imperative verb implies
            you are documenting a task, and you should be using a task topic instead of an ordered
            list.</li>
          <li>Use ordered lists to document processes; make sure it is clear who the actor is in
            each step.</li>
          <li>Do not use an ordered list when the stem sentence refers to the specific number of
            items in the list. Only use the ordered list if the sequence or priority is
            important.</li>

      <title>Reusing List Items</title>
      <p>To allow for the possibility of reusing list items in other locations, follow these guidelines:<ul>
          <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Do not insert a

          <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Include closing
            punctuation on list items only if all items in the list are complete
            sentences.<?oxy_custom_end?> This maximizes reuse potential when the context of a list
            item is not known.</li>
          <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>You can nest block
            elements, such as paragraphs and notes in list items, but limit their use to keep the
            list as simple, reusable, and scannable as possible.<?oxy_custom_end?></li>
          <li><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Capitalize the
            first word in each list item, unless the word should never be capitalized such as a list
            of commands.<?oxy_custom_end?></li>
          <li>When including a list in a collection file, give each list item a unique ID so that
            each can be referenced separately as needed. See <xref
              href="c_CollectionFiles.dita#concept_vtz_r2q_xh"/> for more information on using
